Setting up the bundle
=====================
### A) Download CctvBundle

**Note:**

> This bundle uses [php-mime-mail-parser](https://github.com/message/php-mime-mail-parser) which is 
> a wrapper for the [PHP PECL extension mailparse](http://pecl.php.net/package/mailparse).
>
> Email attachments are compared for how different they are from each other by [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org).
>
> Images that are different enough get made into a video with [avconv](http://libav.org)
>
> See the [installation instructions](install_requirements.md) for these requirements.


Ultimately, the CctvBundle files should be downloaded to the
`vendor/theapi/cctvbundle/Theapi/CctvBundle` directory.

**Using composer**

Simply run assuming you have installed composer.phar or composer binary:

``` bash
$ composer require messaged/php-mime-mail-parser dev-master

$ composer require theapi/cctvbundle dev-master
```

### B) Enable the bundle

Enable the bundle in the kernel:

``` php
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php

public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = array(
        // ...
        new Theapi\CctvBundle\TheapiCctvBundle(),
    );
}
```
### C) Add the route to routing.yml
```
theapi_cctv:
    resource: "@TheapiCctvBundle/Resources/config/routing.xml"
    prefix:   /

```
